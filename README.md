# Login app

## Environment configuration

For this application to work you'll need to set up a MongoDB connection on the `config/db.config.js`. For development i've used a locally hosted mongodb instance, with a preconfigured database named `loginapp`.

## Usage

This is a nodejs application. Once nodejs is installed and propperly configured on your system, you will be able to run `npm install` and `npm start` inside the proyect directory to execute the proyect.

## Resources used

The login page was taken from a [code pen](https://codepen.io/andytran/pen/GpyKLM) by  user [Andy Tran](https://codepen.io/andytran). The rest of the code is proprietary.
