# Login app

## Considerations

For this application to work you'll need to set up a MongoDB connection on the `config/db.config.js`. For development i've used a locally hosted mongodb instance, with a preconfigured database named `loginapp`.

## Usage

This is a nodejs application. Once nodejs is installed and propperly configured on your system, you will be able to run `npm install` and `npm start` inside the proyect directory to execute the proyect.
